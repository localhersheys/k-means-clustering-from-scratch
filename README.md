# k-means-clustering-from-scratch
this k-means classifier is made wholly on python and numpy, while using matplotlib to plot the graphs.
(although the graph don't really help since i've made it multivariate so it cannot be well visualized in a 2d graph)

the code contains a commented portion, that is also another approach to do the k-means classification, in which i select the centroids from the dataset itself by using indexes. in the uncommented code, the centroids are just random values in the range of the dataset, which may not necessarily be in the dataset.

personally, i prefer the commented/indexed one as it gives more consistent results.
that sums up all my thoughts about this project as of now.
see you around, byee :D
